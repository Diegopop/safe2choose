/* Recomendations: 
	* The colors of the social media icons, don't fit with the colors of the page. So, I think 
	that changing the colors of them, it will look better. 
	* The same problem with social media icons in the footer.
	* Personally, I don't like the organization of the items in the header when the size of the
	viewport changes.
	* With another design, we could move the social media section and the lenguages box, to the nav 
	section. With this, we could remove the black section and just let the banner section and the
	nav section.
	* I think that the <<get in touch>> and <<contact us>> setions should be in another social 
	icon. Like an email icon, for example. 
	* I like the page, but at the same time, I think that the design, it's very simple. We can 
	do something about it.
